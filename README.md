# RFID-based-Door-Lock-System-with-Live-Attendance-and-Live-Status-Update
Created IoT-based RFID Door Lock System with live Attendance based on NodeMCU, RFID module, and Solenoid Door lock. 

A javascript-based website was created which records the attendance of students at every entry and exit with time and date record, and it also provides the live status of students with their unique user id, who are currently present in Maker's Space after fetching data from google firebase where all live data is stored.
